  lines1:
  - Welcome to Hell! You must be the new guy, what was your name again? Ahh, doesn't
    matter, I just need a drop of blood. *Stabs your hand with dagger*. You really
    messed up in life huh? Managed to make your way all the way down to the 9th layer
    of Hell, quite a feat to be honest.
  - Hmmmm, weird...
  - You don't seem to be on the list. You're not on any of the lists actually. Shit,
    that can't be good. You weren't supposed to go to Hell.
  - Okay, let me think for a second. *Snaps finger like he got an idea* I know what
    to do! Although you might not like it. You are going to have to fight your way
    through the layers, and escape through the gates. This is going to be very difficult,
    but I mean, it'll be a lot better than sticking around, and you got the time.
  - No need to worry too much though! Death isn't the end down here, as anytime you
    die on any layer, you will just wake up, right back here with me.
  - Here, take this dagger, don't mind the blood, you know where it came from. Let
    me see what you got!
  lines2:
  - Not terrible, who knows, you might actually make it through a couple of rooms.
    You are going to have to get some better gear though, which, luckily for you,
    already comes with what you are about to do.
  - You need Souls to upgrade yourself and your gear, but we'll talk more about that
    once you actually have some Souls.
  - Souls can be found in a bunch of different ways, killing devils will get you
    a bunch of Souls, but they can also be found in chests, which may be found across
    the layers.
  - Devils, I should clarify, are the big ugly guardians at the end of every layer.
    Taking out one of those assholes is no small feat though.
  - To reiterete, come see me after you have some Souls, we'll talk. If you need
    help again in the future, don't hesitate to come talk to me again! Regardless,
    you should get going, you only have all of eternety after all.
  defaultLines:
  - Remeber to spend your Souls! They'll make you life much easier in the layers.
  - For example, you could spend some of them with me, and I can infuse some of that
    energy into you. Essentially that just means, that I'll make you stronger, if
    you pay me for it.
  - Additionally, keep in mind, that different weapons are used differently. I know
    truely thought provoking stuff, but I mean it, remember not to stick with a weapon
    you don't like the attack pattern of. Go talk to Barbara, she'll sort you out.
  - You should also remember, you're gonna have to buy the equipment first. Go talk
    to Alexander, he won't give you a good price, but no-one else will either.
  - Also, you might want to talk to Jens, they can teach you to get the maximum potential
    out of your equipment.
